# map_multiple_markers_spike

I created this repo as a way to test how to display multiple map markers on a google map with info windows.  It was a quick
spike to see how the code worked with static map markers.

This code was used as a starting point for our group project.  However, we quickly switched to using ng-map and needed to display map
markers dynamically so this was a jumping off point, but quickly became outdated due to the nature of our project.
